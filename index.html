            <h2>Cloud Architect and Home Lab Hobbiest</h2>
            <p>Way back in the ‘90s, I kicked off my career in television as a graphic designer and animator—think flashy transitions and graphics that would make your dial-up modem sweat. But then, the internet came knocking, and I couldn’t resist the call of the wild web. I transitioned into the world of IT, focusing on video streaming—back when buffering was basically a rite of passage. Fast forward to today, and I’ve fully leveled up to a cloud architect, designing cloud infrastructure that keeps things running smoother than a cat meme on fiber internet. It’s been one wild, pixelated ride!</p>
